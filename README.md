# scratch_PID
PID controller from scratch in python to facilitate understanding of the underlying concepts. Implements 8 improvements over the most basic PID algorithm. 

Improvement # 1: Consistent Time Sampling
I was unable to effectively implement a consistent sample time. I believe the reason for this is that the update rate required to keep the pole steady is approximately equivalent to the frequency with which the computer can run the loop (especially with the graphics). But this means that the sample rate is a little inconsistent. So if I set the sample time near the natural update rate (about 50 Hz) sometimes the refresh rate will be just a bit slower, which will cause the controller to suspend its computation until the cycle, but then you're looking at appoximately doubling the interval, not to mention the fact that much of the savings from this approach involves saving computation by assuming a constant interval. Alternatively if I set the sample rate lower, the computer can't keep up and while it might compute at the same rate as the unmodified version, the assumption that the time between intervals is the sample time does not hold, which leads to errors in the integral and derivative terms.
